Hi, I'm Austin.  I'm a professional Backend Engineer, with extensive Rust and Java experience.  I'm the author and maintainer of [tab](https://github.com/austinjones/tab-rs), an intuitive, config-driven terminal multiplexer.

At work I design, build, and deploy Rust and Spring Boot services.  I've also done Systems work, mostly on AWS, 
deploying Dockerized applications on EC2, and ALB/ECS.

In my spare time I'm a Generative Artist (see [my portfolio](https://austinjones.onfabrik.com/portfolio/texture-from-nothing)).  I use Rust and GPUs to generate intricate images for canvas prints.  I use <mark>Machine Learning</mark> to solve creative problems 
in Pytorch.
